     * Port: Control port (usually 1259 for VISCA)
     * Protocol: Select VISCA, LANC, or Custom
     * Model: Choose exact camera model

2. Camera Settings:
   - Video Configuration: Resolution, frame rate, compression
   - Control Settings: Pan/tilt speed, zoom speed, focus mode
   - Preset Management: Set, name, and organize presets

3. Testing:
   - Test connection and verify green status
   - Check camera response time
   - Verify all control functions work properly

Common Troubleshooting Issues:

Connection Problems:
- Camera not responding: Check network connectivity and IP address
- High latency: Optimize network configuration, reduce video bitrate
- Intermittent control: Replace network cables, check switch ports

Software Issues:
- Application crashes: Check system requirements and available memory
- Preset drift: Update firmware, recalibrate presets
- Slow response: Monitor CPU utilization and network congestion

Error Codes:
- ERR_001: Camera communication timeout - Check network connection
- ERR_002: Invalid camera protocol - Verify camera model setting
- ERR_003: License validation failed - Contact technical support
- ERR_004: Insufficient system resources - Close other applications
