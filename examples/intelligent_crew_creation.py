Example: Intelligent Crew Creation with Project Analysis

This example demonstrates how the new Project Analysis Agent works:
1. Analyzes project requirements to determine complexity and domain
2. Automatically recommends optimal number and types of agents
3. Creates a perfectly-sized crew for the specific project

No more guessing how many agents you need!
